    "reasoning": "The Firestore structure is designed to securely manage admin profiles using a path-based ownership model. This approach provides authorization independence and facilitates secure list operations.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** Admin profiles are stored under the `/admin_profiles/{adminId}` path. Authorization is based solely on the `adminId` matching the `request.auth.uid`. There's no reliance on data from other documents to determine access.\n\n**Structural Segregation:** Admin profiles are stored in a dedicated collection (`/admin_profiles`), ensuring a homogeneous security posture. All documents in this collection share the same security requirements (only the admin can access their profile).\n\n**Access Modeling:** Path-based ownership is used (`/admin_profiles/{adminId}`).\n\n**QAPs:**\n*   Secure `list` operations are supported because authorization is based on the `adminId`, preventing unauthorized access to profiles.\n*   The structure avoids using rules as filters, ensuring that list operations are secure and efficient."
